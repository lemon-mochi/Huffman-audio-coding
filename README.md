# Huffman-audio-coding
Program that uses entropy coding to perform lossless compression on a stereo audio file. This program does not actually perform any lossless compression, meaning the size of the file will not change. This program only works on stereo audio files. I have only tested this on Ubuntu. I do not think it works on Windows.
